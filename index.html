        Born in Guadalajara in 1902,
        <strong>Luis Ramiro Barragán Morfín</strong> is regarded as the most
        prominent figure in modern Mexican architecture. By the time of his
        death in 1988, his persona and way of working had attained almost
        mythical status, and the interest in his oeuvre has increased ever
        since.

      <h2>Notable Works</h2>
      <p>
        Praised in the Pritzker Prize laudatio for “his commitment to
        architecture as a sublime act of poetic imagination”, Barragán’s
        architectural approach embraced the principles of Modernism while
        remaining deeply rooted in Mexican tradition.
        <br />
        Below are a few notable examples of his work.

      <h3>Luis Barragán House and Studio</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <img
            class="works"
            src="/img/casa-barragan-exterior.jpg"

      </ul>
      <p>
        Located in the west of Mexico City, the residence was built in 1948
        after the Second World War. It reflects Barragán's design style during
        this period and remained his residence until his death in 1988. In 1994
        it was converted into a museum.
        <br />
        The house became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004.

      <h3>Casa Giraldi</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <img
            class="works"
            src="/img/casa-giraldi-courtyard.jpg"

      </ul>
      <p>
        The last project Barragán completed before he died, Casa Gilardi is
        known for the huge jacaranda tree decorating its interior courtyard, and
        for a striking hallway with vertical apertures that bounce sunlight
        against brightly painted yellow walls and out into an electric blue room
        with an indoor pool.
        <br />
        It was built in 1976, within the Federal District of Mexico, in a
        village called Tacubaya, and remains one of the few Barragán-designed
        homes still in good shape and open to the public.
